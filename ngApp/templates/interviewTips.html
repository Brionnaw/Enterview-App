    You probably already know that an interview isn't just a chance for a hiring manager to grill you—it's your opportunity
    to sniff out whether a job is the right fit for you. Which means: It's important to go in with some questions.
    What do you want to know about the position? The company? The department? The team?
    <br>
    To get you thinking, we've put together a list of key questions to ask in your interview.
    We definitely don't suggest asking all of them rapid-fire—some of this stuff will certainly be covered during the course of your discussion,
    and you can weave in other questions as you go.
    <br>
    But when the inevitable, "So, do you have any questions for us?" part of the interview comes?
    Use this list to make sure you've covered all your bases.
